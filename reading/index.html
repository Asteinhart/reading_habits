      <p>
        As a child, I was a voracious reader (if only to rack up Accelerated
        Reader points,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-to-get-a-lot-of-accelerated-reader-points"
          >iynyk</a
        >). However, as the story often goes, my reading plummeted in high
        school. In my 10th-grade English class, we watched more movies than we
        read books, and in my 12th-grade Literature class, I managed to read
        only two of the ten-plus books we were assigned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, college brought back my love for reading, in part due to two
        close friends who were English majors. Their passion for books
        reinvigorated my love for reading, and the summer after my first year of
        college I dove back in by reading one book per week over the summer.
        Since this reentry into reading, I consider myself a generally
        consistent reader, even going so far as to declare reading “a hobby of
        mine” when meeting new people.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that being said, I by no means consider myself a particularly quick
        or prolific reader, but I do consider myself someone who collects
        copious amounts of personal data about myself. To that end, I have
        logged not only every book I have read since 2016 on Goodreads (yes I
        know I should switch to
        <a
          style="display: inline"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.thestorygraph.com/"
          >StoryGraph</a
        >) but also a star rating, a finish date, and even occasionally a
        review.

          I have tracked the date I finished every book I have read since 2016
          on Goodreads. I did not track the start date, but since I rarely read
          more than one book at a time, I imputed a start date for every book
          using the completion date of the last book I had read. This
          methodology has the effect of exaggerating my average reading rate.
          For example, it may appear it took me 30 days to read a book but in
          actuality, it took me a week because I did not start the book until
          three weeks after I had finished the most recent book. While not a
          perfect representation of my reading over the last few years, it
          should work relatively well.

          In the <span class="college-summer-text">summer of 2016</span>, I
          challenged myself to read one book per week in an attempt to revive my
          reading which was for the most part successful! Exploring a possible
          career in law and working in my hometown prompted me to pick up titles
          related to race and socioeconomic factors. Almost all the books I read
          were nonfiction, a trend we will see persist.

          After this jump-start, I had a hot streak during which I read
          <b>1.8 books a month </b> in the first half of college. During the
          second half, my reading pace declined as I only read
          <b>0.4 books a month.</b> It must have been the dread of the unknown
          ahead slowing me down.

          As I settled into full time work and the COVID-19 pandemic began, I
          miraculously had my most consistent period reading
          <span class="covid-text"> 3.2 books a month</span>. I also read 47
          books in 2020, my all time one year record.

          In October 2021, I started a new job and soon after moved to New York
          City in the start of 2022. Through all these transitions, my reading
          took a bit of a hit and I read only
          <span class="moving-text">1.2 books a month</span> during this period.

          Outside of a
          <span class="college-summer-text">small slowdown</span> in the fall of
          2022 during which I was applying to graduate school, my reading picked
          back up in 2022 and 2023 as I read
          <span class="nyc-text">1.9 books a month</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scroller" id="step6a">
        <p>
          One notable development during this period came in July of 2023 when I
          got my first eBook reader. I rode the high horse as a
          physical-book-type-person but when I found out an eBook fits in my
          Uniqlo crossbody bag and that the battery lasts for weeks at a time,
          it was hard to argue with the convenience.

        <p>
          As I alluded to, in the fall of 2023 I began graduate school and
          generally was able to keep a decent pace, reading
          <span class="grad-text">1.7 books a month</span> over the first few
          months. However, I almost certainly will not be able to maintain this
          pace for much longer.
