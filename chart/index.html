        <p> As a child, I was a voracious reader, if only to rack up accelerated reader points (I clearly was a competitive child). However, this good hobby dropped off in high school. 
            In 10th grade, I watched more movies in class than books I read, and in my 12th-grade literature class, I managed to read a whopping two of the required ten-plus books 
            we were assigned to read over the school year. </p>
        <p>As I started college, my two closest friends were English majors and wouldn't shut up about it. Their passion for books must have reinvigorated my love for reading as the first 
            summer after college, i dove back into reading by setting an ambitious goal of reading a book a week over the summer (which i accomplished!). After this impassioned reentry into 
            reading, I have considered myself a generally consistent reader. Follow along as I explore my reading journal over the last eight years.</p>

                <p>I have tracked the date I finished every book I have read since 2016 on Goodreads (yes I know I should switch to the StoryGraph). I did not track the start date but since 
                    I rarely read more than one book at a time, I imputed a start date using the completion date of the last book I had read. This methodology appears to exaggerated my average 
                    reading rate. For example, it may appear it took me 30 days to read a book but in actuality, it may have taken a week but I did not start the book until 3 weeks after I 
                    had finished the most recent book.  </p>

            <p>In the  <span class="college-text">summer of 2016</span>, I kickstarted my reading by reading a book a week. I was exploring a possible career in law as well as working in my hometown 
                which prompted me to explore more topics related to race and socioeconomic factors. Thus, most of the books have to do with sociology or law.  </p>

            <p>Overall, I had a hot start, first half of college where I read on average  <span class="college-text"> 1.8 books a month </span>. The second half where I only read <span class="grey-text"> 0.4 books a month </span>. </p>

            <p> As I settled into full time work and the <span class="covid-text"> COVID-19 </span> began, somehow I had my most consistent period of reading.

            <p>In October 2021, I started a new job and soon after <span class="moving-text">moved</span> to New York City in the start of 2022. Through all this transitions, my reading took a bit of hit as I averged only <span class="grey-text"> 1.2 books a month </span></p>
