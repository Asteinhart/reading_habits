        <p> As a child I was a voracious reader, if only to rack up Accelerated Reader points (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-to-get-a-lot-of-accelerated-reader-points">iynyk</a>). However, my reading plummeted in high school. 
            In 10th grade, I watched more movies in class than books I read and in my 12th-grade literature class, I managed to read only two of the required ten-plus books 
            I was assigned.</p>
        <p> College brought back my love for reading in due to my two closest friends were English majors and wouldn't shut up about it. Their passion for books must have reinvigorated my love for reading as the first 
            summer after college, i dove back into reading by setting an ambitious goal of reading a book a week over the summer (which i accomplished!). After this impassioned reentry into 
            reading, I have considered myself a generally consistent reader. </p>
        <p> I by no means consider myself someone who reads a crazy amount of books but I do consider myself someone who will 
            jump on any chance to collect copious amounts of personal data about myself. </p>
            <p> Scroll along below as I explore the reading over the last eight years.</p>

        <div class="content">
                <p>I have tracked the date I finished every book I have read since 2016 on Goodreads (yes I know I should switch to <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.thestorygraph.com/"
                >StoryGraph</a>). I did not track the start date but since 
                    I rarely read more than one book at a time, I imputed a start date using the completion date of the last book I had read. This methodology appears to exaggerated my average 
                    reading rate. For example, it may appear it took me 30 days to read a book but in actuality, it may have taken a week but I did not start the book until 3 weeks after I 
                    had finished the most recent book.  </p>

            <p>In the <span class="college-text">summer of 2016</span>, I challenged myself to read a book a week in an attempt to revive my reading which was for the most part a successful! Exploring a possible career in law and working in my hometown 
                prompted me to pickup titles related to race and socioeconomic factors. Almost all the books I read were nonfiction, a trend we will see persist.</p>

            <p>After this jump-start, I had a hot streak in which I read <span class="college-text"> 1.8 books a month</span> in the first half of college with most of the 
                reading happening during breaks. During the second half, my reading pace declined and I only <span class="grey-text">0.4 books a month</span>. 
                It must have been the dread of the unknown ahead slowing me down.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="step4">
            <p> As I settled into full time work and the <span class="covid-text"> COVID-19 pandemic</span> began,  I miraculously had 
                my most consistent period of reading. During this time, I read <span class="covid-text"> 3.2 books a month</span> 
                and read 47 books in 2020, the most in year to date.</p>

        <div class="scroller" id="step4a">
            <p> During this period, <span class="nonfiction-text">75%</span> of the books I read were <span class="nonfiction-text">nonfiction</span>

            <p>In October 2021, I started a new job and soon after <span class="moving-text">moved</span> to New York City in the start of 2022. 
                Through all this transitions, my reading took a bit of hit as I read only 1.2 books a month.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="step6">
            <p>Outside of a <span class="grey-text">small slowdown</span> in the fall of 2022 in which was I applying to graduate school, my reading picked back up in 2022 and 2023 as 
                I read <span class="nyc-text">1.9 books a month</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="step6a">
            <p>One notable development in this period is that I got my first ebook in July of 2023. I rode the high horse as a physical-book-type-person 
                but when I found out an ebook fits in my Uniqlo crossbody bag and that, it was hard to argue with the convenience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="step7">
            <p>As I allude to, in the fall of 2023 I began <span class="grad-text">graduate school</span> and generally was able to keep a decent pace, 
                reading <span class="grad-text">1.7 books a month</span>. However, I almost certainly will not be able to maintain this pace for much longer.</p>
